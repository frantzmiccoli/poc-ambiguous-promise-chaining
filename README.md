### Purpose

I have wasted hours understanding the subtlety of promises chaining. I think its
worth sharing.

The article is available on [my blog](http://thedarkside.frantzmiccoli.com/tricks/2014/07/22/ambiguous-asynchronous-chaining-promises.html)

### To make it work

If you don't have it ready install coffee script:

    npm install -g coffee-script

Then in the project folder:

    npm install

To check what can be confusing look at the file and call them through:

    coffee expected.coffee
    coffee whatididntexpected.coffee
